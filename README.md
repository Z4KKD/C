# C Practice Repository

Welcome to the C Practice repository! This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises covering various topics. Each exercise focuses on a specific concept or feature of the C programming language to help you improve your skills.

## Topics Covered

1. **Function Prototypes**: Learn how to declare function prototypes to inform the compiler about the functions used in the program before their actual definitions.

2. **Ternary Operator**: Understand the usage of the ternary operator (`? :`) as a concise way to write conditional expressions.

3. **Circle Circumference Program**: Practice writing a program to calculate the circumference of a circle based on its radius.

4. **Temperature Conversion**: Explore temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

5. **`typedef` and Structs**: Utilize `typedef` to create aliases for data types and learn how to define and use structs in C.

6. **Reference and Dereference**: Understand the concepts of reference and dereference, particularly when working with pointers.

7. **Tic Tac Toe Game**: Implement the classic Tic Tac Toe game to enhance your understanding of loops, arrays, and conditionals.

8. **File I/O**: Learn how to work with files in C, including writing data to files and reading data from files.

9. **Pointers**: Dive deeper into pointers, memory addresses, and their usage in C programming.

10. **Bitwise Operators**: Explore bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) for manipulating individual bits within variables.

11. **Random Seeds and Enums**: Practice generating random numbers using seeds and using enums to define custom data types.

12. **Sorting Arrays and Arrays of Structs**: Implement sorting algorithms to sort arrays and arrays of structs, enhancing your algorithmic skills.

13. **User Input and Formats**: Learn how to accept user input, format input/output, and handle different data types.

14. **While Loops and Nested Loops**: Master the usage of while loops, nested loops, and 2D arrays for solving various problems.

15. **Continue and Break**: Understand the `continue` and `break` statements and their usage in loop control flow.
